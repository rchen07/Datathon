Here you can find all of the code files that we used to create this project. 

**Data Wrangling**
We cleaned the data using Pandas by removing null values and other anomalies, Exemption 4 products (due to their lack of specificity), as well as standardizing the ages for all patients. We also separated all case outcomes according to individual cases to look at the distinctive impacts of products.

**Visualization**
We used a variety of visualizations, including bar plots, heat maps, violin plots, histograms, pie charts, word cloud, and more. We also used a Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to  analyze the association between sets of symptoms and find the top 30 most informative adverse events.

**Findings and Analysis**
We created a scaling system that assigned points to specific outcomes based on their severity, and averaged the point values across all product descriptions to identify the mean outcome for every product. We report that Alcoholic Beverages, Powder Formula, Medical Foods, Vitamins/Supplemtns, and Meal Replacements achieved the highest overall outcomes scores overall, indicative of relative severity across all reports. We looked at deviation within this scaling system to identify what products did not show regular outcomes. The FDA should employ better strategies when regulating these products. We also analyzed two case studies that exhibited notable trends in our analyses and incorporated outside socio political data to obtain a better understanding of the trends in cases for Kratom, as well as Johnson and Johnson products.

We request the FDA to implement better regulation on supplementary products and cosmetics across the board. When looking at specific products, Kratam and Johnson and Johnson and any affiliated products ought to be banned immediately.

**Technical Skill**
This project involved us going beyond our comfort zone through exploring new libraries, visualization techniques, and methods to parse through data. We also created a model scoring system based on severity of outcome in order to use our given data to predict products that should be removed. This scoring also predicts the severity of any incoming reports based on previous data.

**Social Impact**
In addition to thoroughly analyzing our categorical and quantitative variables, we also employed an interdisciplinary approach by extending beyond what we were given, and finding socio political evidence to support the trends in our case studies. Not only did this make our observations more sound, it also increased the scope of our project to involve a holistic approach.
